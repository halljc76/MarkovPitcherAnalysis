# MarkovPitcherAnalysis
MLB Pitcher Analysis using order-one Markov Chains and Transition Matrices.

Hello everyone! Before around a week ago, I had no idea what a Markov Chain was, or the potential they held in analyzing the game of baseball. Thankfully, there were a few 
articles and packages that guided me in my journey (credited in the paper's bibliography), as I sought to embark on my first *major* data visualization project! 

This project was completed for the purpose of possible admission into the UNC Baseball Analytics Team at UNC-Chapel Hill. Through a bootcamp hosted by the team, I was introduced
to techniques involving ggplot and web_scraping using the baseballr package (http://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/), among other things. 

I am extremely grateful for the opportunities that have led me to this project, and, irrespective of its short-term results, I am happy to have taken a step forward in my 
vocational journey!

Best, 

Carter Hall
