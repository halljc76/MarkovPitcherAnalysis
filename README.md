# MarkovPitcherAnalysis
MLB Pitcher Analysis using order-one Markov Chains and Transition Matrices.

Hello everyone! Before around a week ago, I had no idea what a Markov Chain was, or the potential they held in analyzing the game of baseball. Thankfully, there were a few 
articles and packages that guided me in my journey (credited in the paper's bibliography), as I sought to embark on my first *major* data visualization project! 

This project was completed for the purpose of possible admission into the UNC Baseball Analytics Team at UNC-Chapel Hill. Through a bootcamp hosted by the team, I was introduced
to techniques involving ggplot and web_scraping using the baseballr package (http://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/), among other things. 

I am extremely grateful for the opportunities that have led me to this project, and, irrespective of its short-term results, I am happy to have taken a step forward in my 
vocational journey!

Best, 

Carter Hall


P.S.: The two .csv files in this repository are there for the user's convenience. They contain the necessary data manipulation done in the .rmd file and can be directly used in accordance with the functions for making the Markov Chains/Transition Matrices, if someone wishes to shortcut the entirety of the code to more directly view the results.
